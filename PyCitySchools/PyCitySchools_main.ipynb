    "### My Analysis after reviewing the results\n",
    "* District summary indicates an overall pass of 65% of students with higher pass percent in reading compared to math\n",
    "* Charter schools have relatively close averages in math and reading pass percent compared to district schools\n",
    "* Top schools with overall pass percentage comes from Charter schools \n",
    "* Per student spending reflects inversely on performance (higher the spending, lower overall passing)\n",
    "  Optimal spend will be the recommendation.\n",
    "* Comparing averages based on school size, small and medium are relatively close as size difference is not too great. \n",
    "  Larger the size, larger is reduction in performance. \n",
    "* Looking at scores by grade, all schools maintain somewhat same average (not too much of deviation) from 9th thru 12th. \n",
    "  So, we can conclude that focus on education for kids be done early on in life."
